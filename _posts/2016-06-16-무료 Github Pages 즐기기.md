본 블로그는 Github Pages를 이용하고 있습니다. Github에 익숙하지도 않은데 거기다가 Jekyll 이라는 것까지.. 어느정도의 지식이 필요한 상황에서 우연히 [Jekyll,Git 을 몰라도 무료 Github Pages 즐기기](http://ilmol.com/2015/01/Jekyll,Git-%EC%9D%84-%EB%AA%B0%EB%9D%BC%EB%8F%84-%EB%AC%B4%EB%A3%8C-Github-Pages-%EC%A6%90%EA%B8%B0%EA%B8%B0.html)를 읽고 이 블로그를 만들어봤습니다.



Entrepreneurs choose to run businesses from home for a variety of reasons, including lower business expenses, personal health limitations, eliminating commuting, or in order to have a more flexible schedule. This flexibility can give an entrepreneur more options when planning tasks, business and non-business, including parenting duties. While some home-based entrepreneurs opt for childcare outside the home,[1] others integrate child rearing into their work day and workspace. The latter are considered work-at-home parents.

Many WAHPs start home-based businesses in order to care for their children while still creating income. The desire to care for one's own children, the incompatibility of a 9-to-5 work day with school hours or sick days, and the expense of childcare prompt many parents to change or leave their jobs in the workforce to be available to their children. Many WAHPs build a business schedule that can be integrated with their parenting duties.

The Fusion Festival combines all styles of the underground electronic music scene and various other styles, sometimes depending on the attendees who choose to play their own music. It is described as a space people go to free their minds from their everyday lives, jobs, studies and other responsibilities. It is the result of the search for an alternative through music, to the system "people are forced to live in". People go to the Fusion to experience a different way of socializing and living, where experiencing one another freely, sharing love for music and art connects different scenes and minds. It is a clothing-optional event. Art installations include performance arts, static artworks, sculptures, art cars and various other forms.

Fusion Festival began in 1997 near the city of Lärz in north-eastern Germany, about 160 km from Berlin and 230 km from Hamburg.
